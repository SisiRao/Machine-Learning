A single hidden layer Neural Network.
To run the program, see command.txt

args:
1. <train input>: path to the training input .csv file
2. <validation input>: path to the validation input .csv file
3. <train out>: path to output .labels file to which the prediction on the training data should be
written
4. <validation out>: path to output .labels file to which the prediction on the validation data
should be written
5. <metrics out>: path of the output .txt file to which metrics such as train and validation error
should be written
6. <num epoch>: integer specifying the number of times backpropogation loops through all of the
training data (e.g., if <num epoch> equals 5, then each training example will be used in backpropogation
5 times)
7. <hidden units>: positive integer specifying the number of hidden units.
8. <init flag>: integer taking value 1 or 2 that specifies whether to use RANDOM or ZERO initialization
that is, if init_flag==1 initialize your weights randomly from a uniform distribution over the range
[-0.1,0.1] (i.e. RANDOM), if init_flag==2 initialize all weights to zero (i.e. ZERO). For both settings,
always initialize bias terms to zero.
9. <learning rate>: float value specifying the learning rate for SGD.
